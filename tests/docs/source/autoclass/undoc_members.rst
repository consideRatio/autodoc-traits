autoclass - undoc-members
=========================

The ``members`` and ``undoc-members`` option combined should present all class
members, including the traits. And with autodoc_traits installed, the attributes
should be presented with their help strings as docstrings.

.. autoclass:: test_module.TestConfigurable
   :noindex:
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
